            <h3>How to get started quickly</h3>

                <p class="note">
                     This quickstart will use Python, though there is nothing
                     Python-specific about pulse.
                </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Install pip (if needed)
                    <pre class="brush: shell">sudo easy_install pip</pre>
                </li>
                <li>Install the mozillapulse helper library. The helper library
                    isn't needed if you are experienced with AMQP and just want
                    to use kombu directly, but it provides a lot of convenience
                    classes.
                    <pre class="brush: shell">pip install mozillapulse</pre>
                </li>
                <li>Get the sample code from <a href="http://hg.mozilla.org/users/clegnitto_mozilla.com/pulsequickstart/file/default/python/consumer.py">http://hg.mozilla.org/users/clegnitto_mozilla.com/pulsequickstart/file/default/python/consumer.py</a>
                    <p>This script will only get messages while it is
                       connected. If it is disconnected and messages come in
                       it will not recieve them when it reconnects. To have the
                       server spool messages in a queue so that the tool never
                       misses anything, mark it as durable:
                       <pre class="brush: python">
                            # Mark as durable...the server spools messages
                            # while the script is disconnected
                            pulse.configure(topic='#', durable=True, callback=got_message)
                       </pre>
                    <strong>Please only do this if you need to and be sure to
                            change the applabel above to something unique and
                            static.  Be sure to delete your queue when you no
                            longer need it so it doesn't grow indefinitely.</strong>
                </li>
                <li>Run the script
                    <pre class="brush: shell">
                        python consumer.py
                    </pre>
                </li>
                <li>The script should just sit there until a test message
                    comes through and it will then print the message data
                    to the console
                </li>
                <li>Inspect the messages, edit the "got_message" function...
                    <strong>do cool stuff</strong>!
                </li>
                <li>You can also replace "PulseTestConsumer" with
                    "NormalizedBuildConsumer" to get events from BuildBot,
                    but <strong>be sure to change the applabel to something
                    else if your script is marked as durable and you change
                    the consumer type</strong>. A full list of consumers can
                    be found <a href="http://hg.mozilla.org/automation/mozillapulse/file/default/mozillapulse/consumers.py">at
                    the bottom of this file in the helper lib</a>.
                </li>
            </ol>

        <p>That's it!</p>
