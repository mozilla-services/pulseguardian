  <h2>What's Pulse?</h2>

  <p>
    Mozilla currently has a ton of different systems that are
    interconnected via polling, screen scraping, email, and other
    brittle methods. To make their lives easier community members
    often build tools on top of this house of cards, adding yet
    another level of scraping and polling. Many systems don't even
    export important data for others to scrape and use, preventing
    better tools from being written.
  </p>

  <p>
    Mozilla Pulse is a message broker / event system system. The
    goal is to eliminate polling and add visibility into all aspects
    of Mozilla and its systems. This allows more robust, dynamic,
    and informative tools.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pulse isn't any one thing. At its heart, it is a RabbitMQ
    system with a particular configuration and a set of conventions
    for using it. Pulse follows the pub-sub pattern, in which
    publishers send messages to topic exchanges, and consumers
    create queues bound to these exchanges in order to subscribe to
    the publishers' messages. The
    <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MozillaPulse">mozillapulse</a>
    Python package provides classes for existing publishers, consumers, and
    messages so you can quickly build Pulse applications.
